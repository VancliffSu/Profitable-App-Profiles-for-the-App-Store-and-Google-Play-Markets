# Profitable-App-Profiles-for-the-App-Store-and-Google-Play-Markets
This project is a part of the Dataquest guided project. I did a further analysis and visulization on my own. All the data I used can be found here Google Play(https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps) and App Store(https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps).  In this project, we seek to find mobile app profiles that are profitable in the App Store and Google Play. The majority of our revenue comes from in-app advertising, which is free to download and install. Therefore, our revenue from any given app is mainly determined by the number of users who download and use it. The purpose of this project is to analyze data to help our developers determine which types of app are more likely to attract users.
